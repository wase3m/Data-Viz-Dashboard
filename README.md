# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Try different visualisations to understand the data set and make a dashboard which answers important questions

## Process
Connect to the data set
Fimilarize with the data types
Try different visualisations with different row and column combinatioms
Make a dashboard 

## Results
I went with Option 2 and selected the Fifa 18 data set as I am a huge football fan and would understand each attribute. I created a bunch of different visualisations ranging from maps to lines to bubbles to forecasting.
I aimed to answer 5 questions with my visualisations :

1) Which country has the most players participating in Fifa 18?
Answer: Top 3 are England, Spain and Germany. (Used Map viz)

2) Which countries have the best players overall?
Answer : Players with Argentinian nationality form a group which is ahead of every other nation in terms of overall rating. (Used Box Plot)

3) What is the effect of age on attributes?
Answer : Most players have their peak from 29-33. (Used Line Viz)

4) Which are the best players in different positions?
Answer : There are different players for different positions. (Used Horizontal Bars with a drop down for each position)

5)Which country has the most valuable players?
Answer : Spain has the most valuable players (Used Bubbles Viz, also included this in dashboard)

## Challenges 
Initially when I tried generating a map for nationality, I wasn't able to and it took me a while to see that the data type was set to string. I changed the data type to Geographic and it worked fine.
Understaning which features are more relevant than others and geenrating visualisations to understand it.
Understanding which attributes are more defining
Creating a parameter to make a list of all attributes took me a while to figure out

## Future Goals
If there was more time I would clean the data a bit more and deep dive into other attributes which were left out. I would remove the outliers in wages to get a more realistic picture.
